## Overview

The `Fifa21.ipynb` notebook performs several key data preprocessing steps, including:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Dropping irrelevant or duplicate data
   - Renaming columns for better readability

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Feature scaling and encoding categorical variables
   - Handling date and time features
   - Creating new features based on existing ones

The final cleaned and transformed dataset is now ready for further analysis, such as building predictive models or exploring trends in FIFA 21 player statistics.
